# Experiments with React and D3

This repository contains various experiments in integrating [React][11] and [D3][10]. I am undertaking the approach of directly integrating the two, rather than relying on a third library.

## My Approach

Specifically, I am following the approach of letting D3 handle DOM manipulations within its realm. Meanwhile, React handles the overall DOM and stays out of D3's realm. For reference, I am following the following articles:

- [Building D3 Components with React][1]
- [Integrating D3 into React][2]

## Alternative Approaches

The most common alternate approach, without using a third library, is to use D3 behind the scenes for math and such, while leaving React fully in charge of the DOM.

## Libraries

Here are some libraries that integrate React and D3 in various ways:

- [react-vis][6]
- [Recharts][7]
- [Resonance][8] is aimed at getting D3 animations into React, from what I can tell
- [Victory][9]
